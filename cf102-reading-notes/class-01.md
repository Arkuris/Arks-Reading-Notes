### **Davids explaination of a _"Growth Mindset"_**

**My view of a growth mindset is taking the steps to learn something new with the expectation of having no clue what you're doing.**

### **Three reminders I give myself to maintain a growth mindset is**

* You're doing this to learn, you wouldnt be learning if you knew how to do it already.
* When you see others succeed, ask how you can succeed the same way they did.
* _"Do or do not, there is no try"_ Master Yoda
