# Class 05 Designing with CSS

What is css? Its a styling language that uses different syntax than other languages like HTML and JS.

When adding CSS to a HTML file you will need to creat a style tag  < style > </ style >

CSS is an abreviation of "Cascading Style Sheets"

## Three Ways to Insert CSS
* External CSS 
* Internal CSS  
* Inline CSS 

## using CSS 
* "Internal CSS" uses a < style ></ style > tag inside HTML and using a selector tag/choosing a class "Internal CSS"
* { } <-- CSS goes in squigly brackets after a tag 
* Format for a command = color:green; Color can be changed to other things to change the document. 
* "Inline CSS" You can add a style attribute into an HTML element < nav style="color blue"></ nav> "Inline CSS"
* "Exxternal CSS" A seperate file that is linked from the HTML doc where you would do your CSS. To link your HTML doc to the CSS you would creat a HTML element. < link href="style.css"> "Exxternal CSS"
