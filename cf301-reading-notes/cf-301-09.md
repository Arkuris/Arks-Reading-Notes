### Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
- Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- A pure function is one that returns the same result when given the same arguments and does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- The benefits of a pure function include predictability, ease of testing, and avoidance of unintended consequences, making code more maintainable and reliable.

4. What is immutability?
- Immutability refers to the state of an object or data structure that cannot be changed after it is created. In functional programming, immutability is a key concept to ensure data consistency.

5. What is Referential transparency?
- Referential transparency is a property of code where an expression can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior. In functional programming, pure functions exhibit referential transparency, enhancing code understanding and reasoning.

### Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

1. What is a module?
- A module is another JS file that is called upon when it is needed in the main file.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
- Require assigns a module to a file.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
- We would use module.export = *name* which lets exported function get called upon by "require". 

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
- module.export
