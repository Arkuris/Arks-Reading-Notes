## Regex
### Regular Expression:
- "Nightmare Inducing" - Think strings and think pattern within string
- Pattern matching syntax for strings.

- String "The rain in spain stays mainly on the plain."
  - pattern goes between 2 forward slashed
  - After the forward slashed comes our modifiers.

- g - Globa modifier
- i - ignore case

How search within a string:

let string = "The rain in spain stays mainly on the plain."
let matches = string.match(/i*/g);

it should return parts of string that have specified thing in the string.

2. REST APIs are designed around a ____.
- REST APIs are designed around resources.

4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?
- The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

https://adventure-works.com/customers

7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
