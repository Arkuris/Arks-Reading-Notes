### API Design Best Practices

1. What does REST stand for?
- REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
2. REST APIs are designed around a ____.
- REST APIs are designed around resources.

3. What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.
- An identifier of a resource is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example:
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

4. What are the most common HTTP verbs?
- The most common HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

5. What should the URIs be based on?
- URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

6. Give an example of a good URI.
- A good URI example is:
https://adventure-works.com/customers

7. What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
- A 'chatty' web API makes many small requests instead of bundling data into larger resources. This is generally bad for performance.

- An unsuccessful GET request returns status code 404 (Not Found).

9. What status code does a successful POST request return?
- A successful POST request returns status code 201 (Created).
