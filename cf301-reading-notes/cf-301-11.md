#### nosql vs sql
Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
- SQL	
  1. Data Structure: SQL databases use a table-based structure with a fixed schema, which means data must fit into predefined tables.
  2. Query Language: SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data.
  3. Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, typically requiring hardware upgrades on a single server to handle increased load.
  4. SQL databases are well-suited for complex queries with powerful SQL query language support.
  5. SQL databases emphasize ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for data integrity.

- NoSQL
  1. Data Structure: NoSQL databases can use various data structures like key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-column stores, offering flexibility in data organization.
  2. Query Language: NoSQL databases often use query languages specific to the database type, such as JSON-based queries or custom query languages.
  3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, allowing you to add more servers to handle increased traffic, making them suitable for large-scale applications.
  4. Complex Queries: NoSQL databases are not as well-suited for complex queries as SQL databases, lacking standard interfaces for such operations.
  5. CAP Theorem: NoSQL databases follow the CAP theorem, emphasizing Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance rather than strict ACID properties.
 	 
 	 
- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  - SQL databases are a good fit for structured data with a predefined schema. For example, data with clear relationships that can be organized into tables like customer information in an e-commerce database.

- Give a real world example.
  - It can include tables for products, categories, and customer orders, all with well-defined relationships.

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  - NoSQL databases are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data with dynamic schemas. For example, social media posts or user-generated content where the data structure may vary.

- Give a real world example.
  - Each user's feed can contain different types of content (text, images, videos), making it a flexible fit for a NoSQL database.

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL databases are well-suited for hierarchical data storage because they use a key-value pair approach similar to JSON. An example is Hbase.

- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  - NoSQL databases, specifically those that are horizontally scalable, are typically better suited for scalability. You can easily add more servers to a NoSQL database infrastructure to handle increased traffic.

- What does SQL stand for?
  - Structured Query Language.

- What is a relational database?
  - A relational database is a type of database that uses a structured format to organize and manage data, emphasizing the relationships between data elements.

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  - A relational database works with a tabular structure, organizing data into tables with rows and columns.

- What is a ‘schema’?
  - A 'schema' defines the structure and organization of the data, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships.

- What is a NoSQL database?
  - A NoSQL database is a type of database that does not rely on a fixed schema and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data.

- How does it work?
  - NoSQL databases work by using various data models like key value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide column stores, allowing flexibility in data storage and retrieval.

- What is inside of a MongoDB database?
  - Inside a MongoDB database, you'll find collections of JSON-like documents that can vary in structure.

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  - MongoDB is more flexible than SQL because it does not require a fixed schema, allowing you to store data with varying structures within the same collection.

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  - The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that it may sacrifice some data consistency (according to the CAP theorem) for flexibility, making it less suitable for use cases requiring strict data integrity and complex queries.
