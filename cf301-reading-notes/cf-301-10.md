### Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

1. What is a ‘call’?
- A call refers to a function invocation in the call stack.

2. How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
- Only one call can happen at a time due to the call stack's single threaded nature.

3. What does LIFO mean?
- LIFO stands for Last In, First Out, which means the last function pushed into the stack is the first to be popped out when it returns.

4. Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
- To generate a call stack, consider the example where thirdFunction() calls secondFunction(), which then calls firstFunction(). The stack order would be firstFunction(), secondFunction(), and thirdFunction().

5. What causes a Stack Overflow?
- Stack Overflow occurs when a recursive function lacks an exit point, causing the browser to throw a "Maximum call size exceeded" error.

### JavaScript error messages

1. What is a ‘reference error’?
- A reference error occurs when you attempt to use a variable that has not been declared or is not in scope, such as trying to access the value of an undeclared variable.

2. What is a ‘syntax error’?
- A syntax error happens when your code contains a structure or pattern that breaks the rules of the programming language.

3. What is a ‘range error’?
- A range error occurs when you manipulate an object with a length property, like an array and provide an invalid length value.

4. What is a ‘type error’?
- A type error happens when you attempt to perform an operation on a value that is of the wrong type.

5. What is a breakpoint?
- A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where the debugger will pause the execution, allowing you to inspect variables and step through the code line by line for debugging purposes.

6. What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
-  A debugger is a tool used in coding to find and fix errors in your code. It allows you to pause the code's execution at specific points (breakpoints), inspect variables, and track the call stack to understand how your program reached a particular state or error.
