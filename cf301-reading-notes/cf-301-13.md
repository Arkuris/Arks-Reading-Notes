- HTTP method: PUT

2. Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
- REST methods requiring an ID parameter: Update (PUT), Delete (DELETE)

### Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API (Watch a Twitch streamer code an Express API in 20 minutes!)

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
- The relationship between REST and CRUD is that CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) correspond to HTTP methods in RESTful API design. CRUD represents the four fundamental functions for data manipulation, while REST defines a set of principles for designing web services, with each CRUD operation mapping to a specific HTTP method.

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
  - Define Resources: Identify the data entities (resources) your API will interact with, such as "animals" in the article's example.

  - Create Endpoints: Design API endpoints (URL routes) for each CRUD operation. For example, "/animals" for reading all animals and "/appointments/:id" for updating a specific appointment.

  - Implement HTTP Methods: Map CRUD operations to appropriate HTTP methods: POST for Create, GET for Read, PUT for Update, and DELETE for Delete.

  - Database Integration: Connect your API to a database to store and retrieve data, ensuring data consistency and persistence.

  - Test and Deploy: Test the API's functionality thoroughly, then deploy it to a web server or cloud platform to make it accessible over the internet.
