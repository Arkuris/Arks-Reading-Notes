### Status Codes Based On REST Methods

1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
  - 100’s = Informational status codes, indicating that the server has received the request's header and will try to fulfill the client's transmission demand.
  - 200’s = Success codes, informing the client that its request was accepted, but not necessarily that it was already processed (e.g., 202 indicates asynchronous processing).
  - 300’s = Redirection codes, indicating that the requested resource is available at a different location, temporary or permanent, and the client should issue a new request.
  - 400’s = Client error codes, signaling issues with the client's request, such as wrong URI or missing authentication. The client needs to correct its input.
  - 500’s = Server error codes, pointing to problems on the server-side, which might be temporary or permanent. The client can retry the request.

2. What is a status code 202?
  - Status code 202 indicates that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future. The response should include an URL to the finished resource or an URL to monitor when it will be available.

3. What is a status code 308?
  - Status code 308 (Permanent Redirect) instructs the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It's helpful when there are multiple endpoints for one resource, but reading from all of them isn't desired.

4. What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
  - What code would you use if an update didn't return data to a client?
Status code 204 (No Content) would be appropriate for an update that doesn't return data to the client. It signifies that the update is complete, but no response body is returned.

5. What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
  - What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
  Status code 410 (Gone) is used when a resource existed in the past but has been deleted or moved, and its current location is unknown.

6. What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
  - The status code is 403, indicating that the client has authorized or doesn't need to authorize itself, but it still lacks the permissions required to access the requested resource.

### Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
  - We use .env to store the MongoDB database string separately for security. It prevents exposing sensitive information in the codebase.

2. What is middleware?
  - Middleware is a function in Express that handles tasks like request processing, authentication, and logging before reaching the route handler.

3. What does app.use(express.json()) do?
  - app.use(express.json()) parses incoming JSON requests, making request data accessible in the req.body object.

4. What does the /:id mean in a route?
  - /:id in a route is a parameter that allows dynamic route handling based on the provided ID.

5. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  - PUT fully replaces a resource, while PATCH partially updates it.

6. How do you make a default value in a schema?
  - To set a default value in a schema, you define it in the schema definition, like default: 'someValue'.

7. What does a 500 error status code mean?
  - A 500 error status code indicates a server error, often due to an unhandled exception or internal issue.

8. What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
  - Status 200 means a successful response, while 201 signifies a successful resource creation, often with a new resource's location in the response headers.
