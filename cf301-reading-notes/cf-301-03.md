### Code Review
* Component State? 
  * Every component has its own state.
  * You can attach methodes to a component that can manipulate that state.
  * State represents values that can / shoue / hopefully will change.

### array.prototype.filter
dong something very specicific, return a boolean in the callback, if we true we keep the item in the new array, if returning false remove the item from the new.

  * .forEach() - loops through an array and does something
  * .map*() - does something, but returns a new array ( as long as your callback returns something)

### React Docs - lists and kys

1. Wh/at does .map() return?
* The .map() function returns a new array containing the results of applying a specified function to each element of the original array.

2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
* You can use the .map() function to loop through an array in React. Inside the map function, you return JSX elements for each item in the array, which will render the desired output.

3. Each list item needs a unique ____.
* Each list item needs a unique "key." It's a special attribute used to identify and track elements in a list, helping React efficiently update and manage the rendering of components.

4. What is the purpose of a key?
* The purpose of a key is to provide a stable identity for elements in a list. Keys help React recognize which items have changed, been added, or been removed. They enhance rendering performance and allow for more accurate component updates in lists.

### The Spread Operator

1. What is the spread operator?
* The spread operator is a rule in JavaScript that allows you to expand an iterable object, like an array or an object, into individual elements or properties.

2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
* The spread operator can:
  * Copy an array
  * Concatenate or combine arrays
  * Use Math functions with an array of arguments
  * Add an item to a list (array)

3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
* Example : const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
            const array2 = [4, 5, 6];
            const combinedArray = [...array1, ...array2];

4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
* Example: const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
           const newItem = 4;
           const newArray = [...originalArray, newItem];

5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
* eExample: const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
            const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };
            const combinedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };

### How to Pass Functions Between Components
* In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
* In your own words, what does the increment function do?
* How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
* How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
