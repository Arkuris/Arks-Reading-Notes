### What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.
1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
  Syntax: These errors are from spelling mistakes that dont allow the code to fully run.
  Logic: The code runs successfuly, but it doesnt give the result you were looking for.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Well spelling stuff wrong or missing a curly bracket in my code. I did that a few times and broke my code. A logic error could be when I was building my table, and I ran into an issue where my grand totals box was creating another entire hourly totals row below the already established hourly totals row. 

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
It will make me work on being diligent with following the syntax, and when I run into logic errors, understanding why they happened and in future code using that knowledge to get the resault I want. 

### The JavaScript Debugger.
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
So the debugger tool will go through your code line by line, top to bottom, and If it runs into an issue with it, it will stop running the script where it found the issue, and then notify the developer of that issue.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
A breakpoint is where you want to code to pause its exicution when it runs into an issue.

3. What is the call stack?
The Call Stack shows the developer what code was exicuted to get to the current line they stop at or when they reach a breakpoint.
