### JavaScript Canvas

1. What does the < canvas> allow a developer to acheive?
A: The < canvas> element allows a developer to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript. It provides a blank canvas on which the developer can use JavaScript to draw shapes, text, images, and other objects.

2. What is the importance of the closing < /canvas> tag?
A. The importance of the closing < /canvas> tag is that it defines the end of the canvas element. Unlike the < img> element, which doesn't require a closing tag, the < canvas> element requires it to work properly.

3. Explain what the getContext() method does.
A. The getContext() method is used to access the rendering context of the < canvas> element. It takes one argument, such as "2d," to get a 2D rendering context object. This context object allows the developer to draw and manipulate graphics on the canvas, such as shapes and styles using fillStyle and strokeStyle properties.
