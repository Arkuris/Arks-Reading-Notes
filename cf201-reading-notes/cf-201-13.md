1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
A. A developer would use local storage for a web application to store the state of the interface locally on the user's computer. This allows the application to retain data even after the user closes and reopens it, providing a more seamless user experience without the need for server-side storage or user sign ups.

2. What information should not be stored in local storage?
A. Sensitive or confidential information, such as passwords, personal identification data, or any data that could compromise user privacy and security, should not be stored in local storage. Local storage is accessible to JavaScript running on the same domain, making it vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting.

3. Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
A. Local storage can only store data in string format. If you need to store complex data types like objects or arrays, you must convert them to JSON format using the JSON.stringify() method before storing. When retrieving the data from local storage, you can use JSON.parse() to convert it back to its original format.
