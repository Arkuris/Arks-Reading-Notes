Video and Audio Content
1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
Flash and silverlight both had issues involving security and accessibility. Now using html elements, we can link videos directly into websites.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the < video> element.
Its to provide the user a pause and play button, as well as a volume changer.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the < video> element?
If the browser fails to load the video, the fallback content can provide a link and or explain what was there and what the user is missing out on.

4. Write a very short story where < audio> and < video> are characters.
Audio and video are in a show together, audio sings and video dances. They need to be completely in sync for their show to be performed right. Anyway they do great to sync up and their show is a great successs. lol.


A Complete Guide To Grid
1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
Flex and Grid together work really well. Grid layout is a two-dimensional system, allowing control over rows and columns, while Flex is one-dimensional, focusing on distributing elements along a single axis. 

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
  * Grid Container: Parent element that establishes the grid context for its child elements.
  * Grit Item: Child element placed inside the grid container, adapting to the grid layout rules.
  * Grid Line: The dividing lines that create rows and columns within the grid container.


Responsive Images
1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
Making images responsive ensures faster load times, reduces bandwidth usage, and improves user experience

2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
srcset is native to HTML, allowing automatic image selection based on device capabilities, saving bandwidth and loading the most appropriate image size without additional CSS or JavaScript code.
