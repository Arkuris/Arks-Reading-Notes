## async actions

1. Why use Redux middleware?
  - Redux middleware enables writing logic with side effects, like async calls, which can't be done inside reducers due to their pure function requirement.

2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.
  - Async data flow: User events dispatch functions; middleware executes async logic; upon completion, middleware dispatches normal actions to update state.

3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?
  - Async in Redux is managed using middleware, such as Redux Thunk, allowing functions to dispatch actions and access state asynchronously.

## thunk middleware

1. Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
  - Redux-thunk middleware is needed for handling asynchronous operations within Redux action creators.

2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.
 - " function "

3. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.
 - The return value from the inner thunk function is returned by the outer function, allowing you to chain promises.
