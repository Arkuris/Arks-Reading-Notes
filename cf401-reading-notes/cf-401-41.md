## getting started with react native

1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
  - The article does not specify three core components of React Native, so I can't provide their names or descriptions based on the provided text.

2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
  - The article does not directly state the problem React Native solves. However, the term "Native" in React Native typically refers to its ability to interface with native platform components, allowing developers to build mobile apps that perform like native apps on iOS and Android.

3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
  - The article does not explicitly compare the building blocks of a React Native app with those of a React app. However, it implies that React Native uses similar principles as React but is tailored for mobile app development, emphasizing native platform components.

## expo

1. What solution does expo provide?
  - Expo simplifies the process of building React Native applications. It offers a framework and a set of tools that manage the complexities of app development, including compilation, deployment, and testing. This approach makes it easier for developers to create apps for both iOS and Android platforms with consolidated logic and streamlines the overall development process​.

2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
  - Expo is described as managing much of the complexity of building apps, offering a workflow that is more streamlined and developer-friendly compared to traditional app development methods. This approach is aimed at reducing the stress and technical challenges associated with developing React Native apps.

3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
  - React Native is a UI framework that compiles React/JavaScript code into native iOS and Android code. Expo, on the other hand, emerged as a toolkit and framework designed to streamline the development of React Native applications. While React Native focuses on the core framework for building apps, Expo provides additional tools and services like Expo Go, Expo Dev Clients, and EAS (Expo Application Services) to simplify the development process. Expo addresses specific challenges in mobile development and offers a more opinionated approach than the broad framework of React Native.


## expo snack

1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
  - It's a tool for coding React Native apps directly in the browser​.

## ejecting

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
  - In the context of Expo, "eject" refers to leaving the standard Expo development environment to gain full control over the native Android and iOS projects, along with the ability to deal with build configuration or native code.

2. When should you not eject?
  - You should not eject if you want to remain within the Expo's managed workflow, which provides a simpler development environment without the need to handle native code or build configurations.

3. Why might you choose to eject?
  - You might choose to eject to access and have full control over your native Android and iOS projects, to use Expo APIs in a more flexible manner, or to implement custom native configuration and code.
