## Securing Passwords

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how you would safely hash and store a password.
- To safely hash and store a password, you would use a cryptographic hashing algorithm like Bcrypt. This algorithm not only converts the password into a hash but also adds a "salt" to it. The salt is a random value that makes each hash unique, preventing attackers from using precomputed tables to crack passwords.

2. What is Bcrypt?
- Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm. It introduces a work factor, allowing you to control the computational cost of hashing. This makes it slower and more resistant to brute force attacks, making it a secure choice for password hashing.

3. Why might you use something like Bcrypt?
- Bcrypt is used to enhance password security by slowing down the hashing process, making it difficult for attackers to crack passwords using brute force or dictionary attacks. Its adaptability to changing hardware capabilities ensures long-term effectiveness in protecting sensitive user data.

## Basic Auth

1. What is Basic Authentication?
- Basic Authentication is a method in HTTP transactions for a user agent (e.g., a web browser) to provide a username and password when making a request.

2. What properties are necessary in the header of a Basic Auth request?
- The necessary property in the header of a Basic Auth request is "Authorization," which should be in the form of "Authorization: Basic <credentials>."

3. How are username:password in Basic Auth encoded?
- The username:password in Basic Auth is encoded in Base64, where the username and password are joined by a single colon (":") and then encoded into an octet sequence using Base64 encoding.

## OWASP auth cheatsheet

1. Define the authentication process to a non-technical recruiter.
- Authentication is the process of confirming the identity of a user, entity, or website. In web applications, it involves users providing a username or ID and private information to verify their identity.

2. How should your error messaging respond (both HTTP and HTML)? Why?
- Error messaging in both HTTP and HTML responses should be generic, not disclosing whether the user ID or password was incorrect, if the account exists, or if it's locked/disabled. This prevents attackers from enumerating valid accounts based on error messages and maintains security.
