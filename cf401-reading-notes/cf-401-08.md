## 5 steps to RBAC
1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a system for managing access to resources based on user roles within an organization. It assigns permissions to roles rather than individual users, making access management more structured and efficient. RBAC helps enhance security and compliance.

2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
- A sample RBAC hierarchy could include roles like "Basic User" (read-only access), "Customer Service Rep" (read/write access to customer data), and "Customer Database Administrator" (full control of customer data).

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
- To implement RBAC, follow these steps: 1. Inventory systems. 2. Create roles based on workforce needs. 3. Assign users to roles. 4. Avoid one-off changes. 5. Regularly audit and adjust roles as needed. Leveraging tools and identity management systems can simplify the process.

## wiki - RBAC
1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
- Authorization, in the context of authentication, means determining what actions or resources an authenticated user is allowed to access.

2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
  - Role assignment: Users can access permissions through assigned roles.
  - Role authorization: Users can only take on roles they are authorized for.
  - Permission authorization: Users can use permissions based on their active role.

3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
- RBAC is like giving people different hats at work. Each hat (role) comes with certain powers (permissions). You wear the hat that matches your job, and that's what you're allowed to do. It helps organizations manage who can do what easily.

## RBAC tutorial
1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
- Access rights are associated with the role in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Users are assigned roles, and these roles have associated access rights or permissions. Users acquire access rights indirectly through their assigned roles.

2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?
- Access rights or authorization are activated after a user successfully authenticates, proving their identity. Once authenticated, the system determines the user's role and grants them access based on their role's permissions.


3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
- RBAC benefits a business by simplifying access management. It streamlines user permissions by associating them with roles, making it easier to assign and revoke access. This enhances security, reduces errors, and ensures compliance, especially in large organizations with complex access needs. It also helps improve efficiency in user administration tasks.
