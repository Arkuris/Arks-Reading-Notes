### useEffect hook

1. What is the main intended use case for the useEffect hook?
  - The useEffect hook is used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as network connections, browser APIs, or third-party libraries.

2. How does the effect’s logic interact with the component?
  - The setup function inside useEffect runs when the component mounts and after every re-render if dependencies change. A cleanup function (if provided) runs before the setup function on re-renders and when the component unmounts.

3. What is the importance of the return value from the effect’s logic function?
  - The returned cleanup function from the effect's logic undoes or stops what the setup function does, ensuring the component doesn't leave side-effects after unmounting or on dependency changes.
