## Web Sockets

1. What is a Web Socket?
  - WebSocket is a computer communications protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, distinct from HTTP, allowing real-time data transfer between a web server and client.

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
  - To establish a WebSocket connection, the client sends a WebSocket handshake request. The server returns a WebSocket handshake response.

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.
  - Request

## Socket.io Tutorial

1. What does the event handler io.on() do?
  - The event handler io.on() is not explicitly described in the article. However, generally, in the context of Socket.IO, io.on() listens for events on the server side.

2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected
  - The article doesn't provide specific examples of proof of life or proof that the code works as expected.

3. What does socket.emit() do?
  - socket.emit() is not explicitly mentioned in the article. However, generally, in Socket.IO, socket.emit() is used to send events from the server to a client or vice versa.

## Socket.io vs Web Sockets

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).
  - WebSocket is a communication protocol providing bidirectional communication over TCP, while Socket.IO is a library for enabling real-time communication using the WebSocket protocol.

2. When would you use Socket.IO?
  - Use Socket.IO when you need features like broadcasting to multiple sockets, handling connection degradation, browser inconsistencies, automatic reconnection, and working across various platforms or devices.

3. When would you use WebSockets?
  - Use WebSockets for efficient, full-duplex, real time communication between client and server without the overhead of HTTP, especially when you don't require the fallback and additional features provided by Socket.IO.
