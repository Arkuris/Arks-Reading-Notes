### Intro to JWT

1. What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?
- A JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. It can be digitally signed, providing integrity and trust. JWTs can be signed with a secret or a public/private key pair.

2. When should we use JSON Web Tokens?
- JWTs are used for authorization, enabling access to routes and resources after user login, and for securely transmitting information between parties, ensuring sender authenticity and data integrity.

3. Claims are expected in which structural component of a JWT?
- Claims are statements about an entity (e.g., user) and can be registered, public, or private claims, containing relevant data.

### Are JWTs Secure?

1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?
- JWTs are not inherently secure because anyone can decode the payload. However, they can be used securely in combination with encryption and proper verification to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data within the payload.

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.
- The sender and receiver must both know a shared secret key (or the sender's private key in asymmetric encryption) that is used to sign the JWT. The signature in the JWT is created using this key, and the receiver uses the same key to verify the signature's authenticity.

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
- Concatenating content and a secret to create a signature is a technique used in JWTs for authentication and verification. To send it securely to a non-technical recruiter, you would explain the concept without revealing the actual secret. You can illustrate it as a digital fingerprint or seal that ensures the authenticity of the document. The recruiter doesn't need to know the secret itself but should understand that the signature provides a way to verify the document's integrity.

### JWTs Explained

1. Why use JWT?
- JWT is used for its compactness, enhanced security, ease of processing, and scalability, making it ideal for authentication and data exchange on the web.

2. JWT is Compact and self-contained. Describe how this is useful to a non-technical friend.
- JWT's compactness means it efficiently packages and secures data like a digital envelope, ensuring safe sharing and easy handling, just like sending a sealed letter instead of a bulky package.

3. What are the three components (the structure) of a JWT signature?
- A JWT consists of three components: Header, Payload, and Signature. These parts together ensure data integrity, authenticity, and efficient transmission.
