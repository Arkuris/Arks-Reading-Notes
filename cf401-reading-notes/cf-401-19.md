## AWS SQS vs SNS

1. What is the difference betweeen SQS and SNS?
  - SNS is a distributed publish-subscribe service that sends messages to multiple subscribers, supporting various endpoints (email, SMS, etc). SQS is a distributed queuing service where receivers poll for messages, which are not pushed to them.

2. What are some use cases for both SNS and SQS?
  - SNS is used for sending notifications to a wide range of subscribers through various protocols. SQS helps in decoupling and scaling microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications, ensuring messages are processed once.

## AWS SNS and SQS

1. Describe how to use SQS and SNS in a “fanout” pattern.
  - Use SNS and SQS in a fanout pattern by publishing a message to an SNS topic, which then distributes it to multiple SQS queues, enabling parallel processing and decoupling producers from consumers.

2. Explain how “push notifications” work, using SNS.
  - Push notifications via SNS involve publishing a message to an SNS topic, which then pushes the message directly to all subscribed endpoints, such as mobile devices or web servers, in real-time, ensuring timely message delivery.

## SQS and SNS Basics

1. How might a large scale, distributed application make use of a Queue system like SQS?
  - Large scale, distributed applications leverage Amazon SQS to decouple components, ensuring message processing and data transmission reliability, while Amazon SNS facilitates pub/sub messaging, enhancing scalability and robustness.
