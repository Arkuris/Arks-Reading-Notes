    1. Real-time Chat Room: A basic text chat application where users can join different rooms or create their own. The hub server manages room creation, user messages, and user joins/leaves. Clients connect to the hub to send messages and receive updates about the chat in real-time.
   
    2. Server-Side Voting System: A platform where users can propose topics and vote on them. The hub maintains the list of topics, counts votes, and broadcasts updates when  votes are cast. Clients connect to propose new topics or to vote, and they receive real-time results on ongoing votes.
