## An introduction to NodeJS and Express

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.
  - Middleware in Express refers to software components that sit between a web application's request and response. They perform various tasks like processing requests, modifying responses, and handling specific functionalities. Non-technical recruiters, think of middleware as the behind-the-scenes helpers that make web applications work smoothly.

2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.
  - Express is the most popular Node.js web framework.

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
  -  Express being "unopinionated" means it doesn't impose strict rules or conventions on how you structure your web application. It provides freedom and flexibility for developers to choose their own coding styles and libraries, making it adaptable to various project requirements and preferences.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
  - A module is a reusable JavaScript library or file that can be imported into other code. Modularity is valuable to developers because it promotes code organization, maintainability, and reusability. It allows breaking down a complex application into smaller, manageable parts, making development more efficient and collaborative.

## What is NPM?

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
  - 10.1.0

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?
  - npm install jshint

## What is TDD?

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
  - Tests are important because they help ensure that the software we create works correctly and reliably. Just like we check a car's brakes before driving, tests check the software's functionality. They also help catch and fix issues early, saving time and effort in the long run.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing
  - Three benefits of testing are:
  1. Reduced defects: Tests catch problems before they become big issues, resulting in fewer errors in the software.
  2. Efficient development: While writing tests initially takes time, it saves time later by preventing bugs and making it easier to make changes.
  3. Improved code quality: Testing encourages better design and organization, leading to more maintainable and understandable code.

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
  - Individual pitfalls in testing include forgetting to run tests often, writing too many tests at once, and creating overly trivial or large tests. Team pitfalls involve partial adoption of testing, neglecting test suite maintenance, and abandoning test suites over time due to poor upkeep or team changes.
## CI/CD

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
  - Early defect detection and correction, faster release cycles and frequent software updates, and improved code quality with regular testing.

2. What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
  - Continuous Delivery ensures code is always in a releasable state, but manual intervention is needed for deployment. Continuous Deployment automatically deploys every change to production after passing tests.

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background\
  - Think of GitHub as a library of code. CI/CD is a system ensuring every new piece of code added to the library is of good quality and properly arranged. When devs write new updates, the system checks for mistakes and makes the book available or directly places it on the shelf.
