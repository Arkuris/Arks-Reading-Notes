#### nosql vs sql

1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?
  - For a complex query-intensive environment, SQL databases like MySQL, Oracle, or SQL Server would be the best fit. They have powerful query languages (SQL) and are well-suited for handling complex queries efficiently.

2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?
  - For hierarchical data storage, a NoSQL database is a better choice. NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, use a key-value pair approach similar to JSON data, making them suitable for storing hierarchical data structures.

3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.
  - SQL databases are like a single powerful computer that can handle more work by upgrading its hardware, like adding more memory or a faster CPU. In contrast, NoSQL databases are like a team of smaller computers that can handle more work by adding more team members (servers) to share the load. So, SQL scales up, while NoSQL scales out by adding more servers.

#### sql modeling techniques

1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?
  - A one to many relationship in data tables means that for each record in one table (the "one" side), there can be multiple related records in another table (the "many" side). To relate them, you typically use a foreign key in the "many" table, which references the primary key in the "one" table.

2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to ___ a ___ of the database tables and their relationships.
  - Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to create a diagram of the database tables and their relationships.

3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
  - A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table, ensuring each record is distinct. A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column in one table that links to the primary key of another table, establishing relationships between tables and maintaining data integrity.

#### sql vs nosql

1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?
  - In SQL syntax, keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings and functions in the language, such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE. Parameters, on the other hand, are values or placeholders that you provide to customize your SQL queries, such as specifying a condition in the WHERE clause or providing values for INSERT statements.

2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.
  - Normalization in the context of schemas and data refers to the process of organizing a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down tables into smaller, related tables and using foreign keys to establish relationships between them, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.
  - One-to-one relationship: Imagine it's like a unique pair of matching gloves. Each item (record) in one table corresponds to exactly one item in another table, and vice versa. It's a direct match.
  - One-to-many relationship: Picture a parent-child relationship. One item in the first table can be linked to multiple items in the second table, but each item in the second table relates to only one item in the first table.
  - Many-to-many relationship: Think of it as a party where people bring dishes. Multiple items in the first table can be associated with multiple items in the second table, creating a complex web of connections.
