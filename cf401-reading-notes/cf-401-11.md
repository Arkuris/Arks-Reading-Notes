## Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
  - Node.js provides a native module called EventEmitter for incorporating Event-Driven Programming.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
  - Combining Object Oriented Programming with Event-Driven Programming allows for streamlined communication between objects. Objects can emit events, and listening objects process these events, ensuring behavior is self contained and reducing the need for objects to access other objects functions directly.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
  - Imagine a party with a doorbell. On the web, clicking a button is like pressing the doorbell. In the backend with Node.js, Event Driven Programming listens for that doorbell and performs actions, like welcoming guests. So, it helps organize how our software responds to different "doorbell rings" efficiently.
