## AWS API Gateway Overview

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?
  - Amazon API Gateway is a managed service allowing developers to define HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API, connecting these endpoints to backend business logic. It handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
  - API Gateway ties Serverless functions and API definitions together. It enables serverless architectures for web applications by triggering Serverless functions directly in response to HTTP requests, allowing web applications to operate without maintaining any servers.

3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services? 
  - API Gateway integrates with AWS services like Lambda, SNS, IAM, and Cognito Identity Pools. It supports direct integrations to invoke Lambda functions, other HTTP endpoints, and AWS services with HTTP APIs. Additionally, it can return mock responses or connect to services without native integration via Lambda functions.

## AWS DynamoDB Guide

1. What is DynamoDB?
  - DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) with reliable performance, a managed experience, and a simple API.

2. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?
  - Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?
Recommend DynamoDB for applications with large data and strict latency needs, serverless applications using AWS Lambda, and data sets with simple, known access patterns.

## AWS DynamoDB

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.
  - DynamoDB is Amazon's serverless, NoSQL database that provides fast and flexible data storage. It automatically adjusts its capacity based on the user's needs and offers built-in security, continuous backups, and automated data replication across multiple regions. It's used for high-performance apps like gaming, streaming, and online shopping.
