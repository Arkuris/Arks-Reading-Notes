## AWS EC2

1. What is an EC2 Instance?
  - An EC2 Instance refers to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service, which provides scalable compute platform with options for processors, storage, networking, and operating system.

2. Name 2 use cases for EC2.
  - Two use cases for EC2 are:
    - Running cloud-native and enterprise applications.
    - Scaling for high performance computing HPC applications.

3. Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
  - ECS  provided offers more services and control. 

## EC2 For Humans

1. Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
  - Navigate to the AWS Management Console, and in the "Find Services" search bar, type "EC2". Click on the "EC2" option that appears.

2. Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
  - T2 Micro and XL are instance types. Micro is smaller, providing minimal resources suitable for low demand tasks. XL offers more resources, accommodating higher workloads.

3. Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
  - A "Compute Cycle" is like a brain's thought process. Just as our brain processes thoughts, a computer processes tasks in its own cycles.

## Elastic Beanstalk

1. What is Elastic Beanstalk?
  - Elastic Beanstalk is AWS's platform as a service (PaaS) that automates deploying, scaling, and managing applications in the cloud

2. Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Elastic Beanstalk uses EC2 instances to run applications. While EC2 offers virtual servers, Elastic Beanstalk abstracts infrastructure management, providing a simpler deployment process.

3. Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
  - Benefits of Elastic Beanstalk include simplified deployment, automatic scalability, health monitoring, and seamless integration with other AWS services.
