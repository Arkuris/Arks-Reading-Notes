## Ethics in the workplace

### Google and AI
- The article on Google's decision to not use its AI for weapons or surveillance marks a pivotal moment in ethical AI development. This step, influenced by employee protests and ethical concerns, shows Google's commitment to responsible technology use, prioritizing societal welfare over military and surveillance applications. The introduction of AI principles by CEO Sundar Pichai, emphasizing the development of “socially beneficial” AI, sets a commendable precedent in the tech industry. However, the implementation of these principles requires transparency and effectiveness to ensure they go beyond theoretical ideals. The concerns around the ambiguity of these principles, particularly in relation to projects like Maven, underscore the need for continuous scrutiny and public accountability in AI development. Google's move is a significant step towards ethical AI, but it also highlights the journey ahead in achieving truly responsible AI practices.

### Self Driving Car Ethics
- The article on the ethical implications of self driving cars effectively captures the complex moral dilemmas these vehicles present. I agree with his view that while autonomous cars promise significant societal benefits, such as reducing traffic fatalities and improving mobility, they also pose challenging ethical questions. The hypothetical scenarios he describes illustrate the difficulty in programming these vehicles to make moral decisions in life-threatening situations. This highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving technologists, ethicists, legislators, and the public to develop a comprehensive ethical framework for self-driving technology. Spangler's article underscores the importance of balancing technological advancement with ethical considerations, emphasizing that the development of self-driving cars is not just a technical challenge but a deeply moral one.
