### How do useReducer and useContext work together to simplify state management in a React application? (At least two paragraphs of prose.)

1. useReducer and useContext in React: useReducer helps manage state changes in a structured way, while useContext allows state and functions to be accessed easily across different components. When combined, they eliminate the need for "prop drilling", which means you don't have to pass state and functions down through multiple component layers.

2. Benefits for Complex Apps: By pairing useReducer with useContext, you can store all your state logic in one place, making it more organized. Components can access and update the state without needing lots of props. This makes the code cleaner and easier to manage as your app grows.
