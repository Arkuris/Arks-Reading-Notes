## Review API Server Build

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.
- A query string parameter is appended to the URL with a question mark and can be used for filtering results (e.g., ?category=electronics). A path parameter is part of the URL path and typically specifies a specific resource or item (e.g., /products/12345).

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:
    - Domain: http://our-site.com
    - v3
    - model name: stuff
    - id: things

- A: Given the information, the API URL with a path id parameter would be: http://our-site.com/api/v3/stuff/things

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.
- Imagine you're using a universal remote (our interface) that can control any brand of TV (data models). You press a button (make a request) to perform an action like change the channel (retrieve, add, or update data) and the remote communicates with your TV to make it happen.

## Review Auth Server Build

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.
- Middleware for Basic Auth would be used on the /signin route to authenticate users with their username and password. For Bearer Auth, middleware would validate a token provided on other routes requiring a logged-in user.

2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.
- OAuth handshake involves the /oauth route using middleware to handle the exchange of user credentials for an access token from an OAuth provider, then using that to create or update the user account.

3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.
- Role-Based Access Control is like a club bouncer; they check your ID (role) before letting you in certain areas (permissions) of the club (system). Only people with the right ID get past the velvet rope to the VIP section (admin area).
