## Thinking in React

- Summarize the five steps of thinking in react.
  1. Break the UI into a component hierarchy: Split the design into individual components, ideally adhering to the single responsibility principle.
  2. Build a static version in React: Create a version that only renders the UI from the data model without any interactivity, using props for data flow.
  3. Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state: Determine the minimal set of mutable data required and avoid redundancy.
  4. Identify where your state should live: Determine which component is responsible for owning and modifying each piece of state.
  5. Add inverse data flow: Enable child components to update state in parent components, ensuring data flows bidirectionally as required.

## State: A Component’s Memory
1. What is one reason a local variable isn’t sufficient for managing a React component?
  - One reason a local variable isn’t sufficient for managing a React component is that local variables don’t persist between renders and changes to them won’t trigger renders.

2. What is the argument to the useState hook, and what are the two parts of its return array?
  - The argument to the useState hook is the initial value of the state variable. The two parts of its return array are the current state variable and the function to update it.

3. How can Component A access state from Component B?
  - To let Component A access state from Component B, you'd need to lift the state up to their closest shared parent. State in React is local to the component declaring it, so Component A can't directly access Component B's state.
