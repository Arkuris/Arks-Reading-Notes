### Extracting State Logic into a Reducer

1. What is the motivation for adding a reducer?
- The motivation for adding a reducer is to consolidate state update logic outside the component in a single function, simplifying components with many state updates and making the logic easier to access and manage.

2. What are actions in the context of a reducer? How are they different than setting state directly?
- In the context of a reducer, actions are descriptions of what the user just did. They differ from setting state directly because instead of specifying "what to do" by setting state, you describe "what the user did" by dispatching actions. Actions are more descriptive of the user's intent.

3. What common list operation is useReduce named for, and why?
- The name "useReduce" is named for the "reduce" list operation. The article doesn't specify why, but the "reduce" function in JavaScript processes a list of values into a single result, similar to how reducers take various actions and compute the next state.

4. When should you switch from useState to useReducer?
- You should switch from useState to useReducer when state updates become complex, making it hard to track changes in your component's code. useReducer is beneficial when many event handlers modify state similarly or when introducing structure to minimize state update bugs.
