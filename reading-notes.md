# **Davids explaination of a _"Growth Mindset"_**

## My view of a growth mindset is taking the step to learn something new with the expectation of having no clue whawt you're doing.

# Three reminders I give myself to maintain a growth mindset is:

* You're doing this to learn, you wouldnt be learning if you knew how to do it already.
* When you see others succeed, ask how you can succeed the same way they did.
* _"Do or do not, there is no try"_ Master Yoda
